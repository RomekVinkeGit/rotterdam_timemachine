Write a Python module that defines a WikipediaService for retrieving historical context using LangChain and Wikipedia.

Start with the module docstring

Load a Dutch-language Wikipedia wrapper (lang="nl", top_k_results=3)

Load a ChatOpenAI model (gpt-4o-mini) using OPENAI_API_KEY from environment

Define a summary_prompt to summarize a text in 2–3 modern Dutch sentences for 18th-century historical context

Define a keyword_prompt to extract 3–5 relevant Dutch-language historical entities (figures, events, places, organizations, etc.) 

Implement two methods:

extract_keywords: Uses the keyword chain to identify key historical terms in the text, returns a list of up to 5 cleaned strings

get_historical_context: For the top 3 keywords, gets Dutch Wikipedia articles using the wrapper
Runs each result through the summary chain, Returns a list of (keyword, summary) tuples

Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and efficiency. Use .env for managing API keys.

Keep the code as simple as possible"
