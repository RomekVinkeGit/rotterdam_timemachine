Write a Python script that populates a database by parsing XML files.
The script should include:

A module docstring

Imports and required modules from a local package

A function that extracts a date prefix from filenames like "17500604_example.xml" and converts it to a datetime.date object.

A function that returns "Gazette de Rotterdam" if the year is before 1720, "Rotterdamse courant" otherwise.

A that uses simple heuristics to return either "fr" or "nl".

A function Parses the XML using ElementTree Extracts the <title> and first <p> element content Uses the filename 
to extract the publication date Applies the language and newspaper detection functions Returns a NewsArticle object

A main() function that: Initializes a Database instance Reads all *.xml files from the data/articles/ directory 
Iterates through each file, parses the article, and inserts it into the database Uses tqdm to display progress and prints 
the total number of successfully inserted articles

Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and efficiency. Use .env for managing API keys.

Keep the code as simple as possible"
