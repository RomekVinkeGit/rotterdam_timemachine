I want to build a full-stack Python project using AI tools. Here's the project idea:

I have about 2500 Dutch and French newspaper articles from the 18th century in XML format. I want to build:
1. An SQLite database with a single table:
   - ID: unique identifier for each article
   - Date: date of publication (extracted from the first 8 characters of the article title, in yyyymmdd format)
   - Newspaper: name of the newspaper
   - Language: the language of the newspaper
   - Content: the full text of the article

2. A Streamlit app that does the following:
   - Shows a randomly selected article published on this day/month in history
     - If no match, select the article closest in date
     - If multiple, pick one at random
   - Translates the article from old Dutch or French into modern Dutch using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini API, and with low temperature setting
   - Summarizes the article with low temperature setting
   - Extracts keywords from the summary using GPT-4o-mini API and fetches historical context using Langchain Wikipedia integrator

I want you to tell me **what prompts** I should give you in order to write the full project. The prompts should help me generate:
- XML parsing logic
- SQLite database creation and insertion code
- SQLite database population
- Article retrieval by date (closest if exact doesn't exist)
- API calls to OpenAI for translation, keyword generation and summarization
- Wikipedia context fetching
- A Streamlit frontend with appropriate UI components

Also suggest any good file structure and best practices for organizing this project as a portfolio piece.

Please return a list of prompts I can use to build this system step-by-step using an AI coding tool like you.
