Write a modern Streamlit app for a historical project called Rotterdam Time Machine. The app should have a clean and attractive UI 
using custom CSS, allow users to choose a date, retrieve a historical newspaper article from a database, and display a Dutch translation 
and historical context using AI services (OpenAI & Wikipedia). Use session state to preserve values between interactions. 
Use modular design and docstrings.

Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and efficiency. Use .env for managing API keys.

Keep the code as simple as possible"
