Write a Python module for database operations
This module should:

Use sqlite3 to interact with a SQLite database.

Use a Database class to encapsulate all logic.

Include a top-level docstring

Provide methods for initialization, connection management, inserting articles, and retrieving articles by various date filters.

Implement the following functionality in the Database class:

insert_article: inserts a NewsArticle into the DB and returns its ID

get_articles_by_date: retrieves articles for a given date

get_articles_by_day_month: retrieves articles from any year with the same day and month

get_closest_article: retrieves the single article closest to the given date, using JULIANDAY()

get_closest_day_month_article: retrieves the article with the closest day-of-year match, using modulo 365 logic

The database schema should include:

id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)

publication_date (DATE, NOT NULL)

newspaper, content, original_language (all TEXT, NOT NULL)

Follow best practices for modularity, readability, and efficiency. Use .env for managing API keys.

Keep the code as simple as possible"
